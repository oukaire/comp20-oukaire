# Overview

  Here I create a webpage where if I resize the browser screen width, 
  a different part of the image will be rendered.

`garfield.gif` is a 600px by 398px:

    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 1200 pixels, 
       display the top-left image of garfield.gif (i.e., the title banner)
    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 1100 pixels but 
       less than or equal to 1200 pixels, display the second image on the 
       top row (i.e., the first picture of the comic).
    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 1000 pixels but less than 
       or equal to 1100 pixels, display the first image on the second row.
    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 900 pixels but less than 
       or equal to 1000 pixels, display the second image on the second row.
    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 800 pixels but less than 
       or equal to 900 pixels, display the third image on the second row.
    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 700 pixels but less than 
       or equal to 800 pixels, display the first image on the last row.
    *  if the browser screen width is greater than 600 pixels but less than 
       or equal to 700 pixels, display the second image on the last row.
    *  if the browser screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels, 
       display the last image, bottom-right.
