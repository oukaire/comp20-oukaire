# Overview
Dedicated to learning the basics of how the web works, this repository documents my code.

# Favorite Assignment
I enjoyed assignment 4 a lot because it combines all what we learned in class. It's rather simple specifications is misleading to a complexity in deciphering how to attack a web app as well as prevent such an attack. It really fosters the big idea on how the web works.

# My Growth
Though perhaps clich√©, my biggest take-away is understanding how to learn.

# Most important things learned in this course
* Security is just as important as an application. If it is not secure, don't release it!
* Building a Web Application from scratch, eg. Historic Landmarks
* Breaking Historic Landmarks thought me security

# Topic to explore
Front-end tools like bootstrap and flex-box to style a personal website.
