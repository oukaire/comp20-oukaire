  <h2>Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side</h2>

  <div id="introduction">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Historic Landmarks is a web application that renders a map to clients, displaying landmarks within a mile's radius and people checked in via the app. Historic Landmarks has both client-side and <a href="https://fathomless-eyrie-97751.herokuapp.com/">server-side</a> ends. Currently, it serves the New England region, ranging from Connecticut to New Hampshire. As a hired security consultant, I resolved three major security and privacy issues in the applications, and I document those issues on this page.</p>

  <div id="methodology">
    <h3>Methodology</h3> 
     <p>The Open Web Application Security Project documents that 65% of web applications are vulnerable to a list of cyber attacks. Using OWASP's top ten basic security analysis, I hunt for security bridges in Historic Landmarks. In addition, I look for privacy bridges with regards to failure to conceal any client data including real names and latitude or/and longitude coordinates. Most of my injections</p>

    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3> 
    <p>XSS</p>

  <div id ="issues">
    <h3>Issues Found</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>Issue: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
        <li>Location or page where issue was found: "'/sendLocation'" post route on <a href="https://fathomless-eyrie-97751.herokuapp.com/">server</a></li>
        <li>Severity of Issue: High. XSS presents users with all sorts of fraudulent web content including malicous code injection and unwanted messages. Significant amount of data stored as cookies can also be stolen.</li>
        <li>Description of issue: An attacker inputs data to execute a certain javascript function. For example, the shell command, <div id="sh">$ curl --data "login=&ltscript&gtalert('XSS ATTACK');&lt/script&gt&lat=10&lng=10" https://fathomless-eyrie-97751.herokuapp.com/sendLocation"</div> alerts clients contrary to the app's purpose.</li>
        <li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src="xx1.gif" alt="XXS"/></li>
        <li>Resolution: Change &lt to "&lt" and &gt to "&gt". Alternatively, all special characters can be removed via the following command: in the example above, assuming "var login" holds login data, <div id="fix1">"$ login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');"</div></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

        <li>Issue: Mongo Database Injection and Client Security</li>
        <li>Location or page where issue was found: "'/checkins.json'" get route on <a href="https://fathomless-eyrie-97751.herokuapp.com/">server</a></li>
        <li>Severity of Issue: High. A database injection significantly impacts credibility that could lead to getting sued.</li>
        <li>Description of issue: After I made a legitimate checkin into the web app via the login "oxy01", I searched for a login information via get using "login[$ne]=oxy01" and I got other clients'
 data</li>
        <li>Proof of vulnerability: <img src="mongodb_injection.gif" alt="XXS"/></li>
        <li>Resolution: "REPLACE CHARs PERHAPS"</li>
